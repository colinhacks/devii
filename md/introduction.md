Devii is a starter kit for building your personal developer website. Powered by the best technologies 2020 has to offer.

It's not a a framework or a library, it's a just a simple project that contains some useful utilities and patterns that'll help you hit the ground running. In fact, the [GitHub repo for Devii](https://github.com/colinhacks/devii) contains the code for the site you're currently reading!

Devii doesn't try to be a fully functional blog out of the box. After cloning/forking the repo, you'll need to delete the contents of `index.tsx` (the page you're reading now!) and implement your own homepage. Devii makes it easier — for instance, you can access a list of all your blog posts in `props.posts` — but you still have to build the site you're imagining in your mind's eye.

And that's the point! After you clone/fork it, look through this code to learn how Devii works. Then rip out what you don't like, customize everything else, and build your own tools and components on top of the foundation Devii provides!

Devii was designed to place _zero restrictions_ on what your site can be or become. You can use any React component or styling library, pull in data from third-party APIs, even implement user accounts. Your personal website is the online manifestation of you. Don't compromise.
